A smol README.md for my profile

## whoami
A random dev who enjoys {programm,sysadmin,netamdin}ing a bit too much.  
Grew up on Mandriva Linux, switched to Debian, and now using Alpine more and more.  
Mains Lua/MoonScript, JavaScript and C, but can write fairly good Python and Java.  
Will switch from C to Rust at some point.
