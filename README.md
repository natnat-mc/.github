# Codinget
A smol README.md for my profile

## whoami
A random dev who enjoys {programm,sysadmin,netamdin}ing a bit too much.  
Grew up on Mandriva Linux, switched to Debian, and now using Alpine more and more.  
Mains Lua/MoonScript, JavaScript/Typescript and Rust, but can write fairly good Python, Java and C.

## ls ~/projects
- [container](https://github.com/natnat-mc/container), a simple containerization script based on systemd-nspawn
- [rprompt](https://github.com/natnat-mc/rprompt), a small prompt for fish, zsh and bash, written in rust and moonscript
- [moonbuild](https://github.com/natnat-mc/moonbuild), a small build system written in and using moonscript
- [brightnessctl](https://github.com/natnat-mc/brightnessctl), a simple suid binary to set the screen brightness
- [Snek](https://gitdab.com/Codinget/Snek), a "simple" Snake, done for my final JS class project
- [rmarcher](https://github.com/natnat-mc/rmarcher), a small cpu-rendered raymarcher in Rust capable to load Lua scenes
- [mon](https://github.com/natnat-mc/mon), a simple system monitoring tool
- and basically everything here, on my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Codinget) and [GitDab](https://gitdab.com/Codinget)

## ls ~/upcoming-projects
- [dashboard](https://github.com/natnat-mc/dashboard), a small web dashboard for my server, using lapis
- [limglib](https://github.com/natnat-mc/limglib), an image organization tool
- lcontainer **no repo yet**, a lighter container system, not relying on systemd

## ls ~/old-projects
- [prompt](https://github.com/natnat-mc/prompt), a small prompt, mainly designed for fish, the old counterpart of `rprompt`
- [bot-info](https://github.com/natnat-mc/bot-info), a discord bot for the programming school I went to, to be replaced by [Administrator](https://github.com/flifloo/Administrator) by a newer student now that I left
- [toolbox](https://github.com/natnat-mc/toolbox), a small toolbox of CLI tools based on lua, mostly replaced by [lua-command-tools](https://github.com/stevedonovan/lua-command-tools)

## TODO
- [x] make the README
- [ ] work on the project themselves
